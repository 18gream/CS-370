# CS-370

# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself? 
  For the project, the goal was to train the priate or agent to collect the treasure and navigate to it succesffully within its enviornment. The starter code that was already given included the code to shape the enviornment, utility functions, and code to train the priate/agent. The code that I created myself included Deep-Q learning training loops which made the agent decide actions based on the enviornment. 

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  Within this course, I gained a deeper understanding of neural networks and how they work as well as reinforcement learning methods. Overall, this helped me understand more about how computer scientists solve real-world problems by developing these models that can adapt and change overtime with its learning and problem-solving skills. As it relates to this course, computer scientists build and create models or systems that can interpret data and understand directions while computing tasks through algorithims and data. This matters because these same models power autonomous cars, robots, personalized assistants and profound technology that is changing the world as time goes on and more devlopments are made.

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist? 
  To approach a problem as a computer scientist, I break down the problem into smaller problems and complete them with an anayltical mindset. Deeply understanding the requirements of the problem or task is very important for any computer scientist. Testing often and taking feedback into consideration as the devlopment process moves foward is another way to approach problems successfully. 

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization are to make sure my product is fully transparent and does not contain bias or a harmful system. Making sure the user gives full consent to their data being used within the system and is aware of where and how their data is being used is very important. For the organization, it is best to uphold the integrity and standards that are in place for ethics and legal practices regarding intelligent systems.
